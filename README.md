# Quiz-site

## Description
This project is a website that allows the user to play a very simple coding quiz.  It starts on a homepage where they are able to see the current highscore, click a button to see the top 10 high scores they have achieved, or click a start button to begin the game.  Once the quiz has began, the user will have 60 seconds to answer as many questions as they can.  Getting a question wrong will result in a 10 second time penalty.  Getting a question right will give them a score based on how quickly the question was answered.  Once the quiz is over, they will be shown their score, prompted to enter their initials (1-3 letters) and if the score they recieved is a high score, it will be saved to be displayed on the high scores list.  Note that these high scores are all local storage meaning they will only be from and apply to the specific user playing the game.

The major complication and new learning for this project was figuring how to get multiple javascript pages to interact with each other and have access to relevent information.  It was possible to do this by have many items invisible or not display, and be shown or displayed only when needed but I wanted to take a more challenging approach to push my understanding of how javascript works.  After this project I feel much more comfortable with how javascript interacts scope-wise between pages and how to work around some of the challenges that come with that.  This project was also the first time majorly working with intervals, and also used some methods I have never worked with before (sort, slice), as well as dealing a lot with objects.

Future of this project is that it can be adapted to other types of quizes and allowing the user to pick between the type they want (possibly a dropdown menu).  More questions can easily be added to the array of questions allowing for an expansion of the current quiz.
